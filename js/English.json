GGP is a no-nonsense supplier; after working for years with other parties in the energy sector, the three founders decided that things had to be done differently. At GGP, energy contracts can be concluded fairly, easily, and without fuss. To serve its new and existing 20,000 customers, the company GGP employs 30 people; all experts in the field of energy, but not of IT. GGP, therefore, decided to outsource this completely.",
    "useAsass": "GGP uses a SaaS solution for the energy domain to support back-office processes, such as billing and meter reading processing. They hired a third party for acquisition and contracts, who developed various platforms for this. Robin van Klaveren, co-founder at GGP: “That was custom work, but lacked important functionality. The link with our backend system was not properly executed and  maintenance proved to be difficult. Moreover, the platform was not very scalable.” GGP was, therefore, looking for a party that could not only solve these problems but could also think about the future. In November 2019, Van Klaveren met old acquaintance Quincy Verkolf, CEO at The IT Solutions (TIS).",
    "gulfSolution": ["TIS subsequently partly redeveloped the application, because the data model and the associated architecture turned out not to be scalable. TIS built applications for the employee portal, sales portal, and customer portal. In addition, the company provides maintenance for both individual applications and the landscape in general. TIS developed new features and finally, TIS also manages the supplier of the back-office applications. Van Klaveren: \"In the seven months since the kickoff, TIS has created tremendous value with new features and bug fixes.\"Because GGP does not employ its own IT staff, TIS is fully responsible for the development and maintenance of the applications. Until now, this has been done, out of necessity, completely remotely. The lines are short though; when contact is needed, Van Klaveren and his colleagues can quickly reach the right TIS people. \"We have to because we have been in the clean-up and furnishing phase so far, but if we take the next step soon, we will be brainstorming.\"",""],
    "waiveHelps": "Waive helps hoteliers to digitize service. The goal is simple: Improving the guest experience while increasing the hotel's revenue. Main focus of Waive is the support within this process, in order to contribute to the digital transition of the hotel owner. Waive co-created this SaaS solution together with The IT Solutions (TIS). In the search for a partner who could help build an MVP, Waive entered into dialogue with The IT Solutions (TIS) on the advice of one of the investors. “When starting a company, you have to deal specifically with the development budget. There is not much room to experiment with different partners,” says Nout Knabben, founder and CEO of Waive. \"TIS turned out to be the right partner for fast and targeted development.\"",

The MVP was actually built based on short sprints according to the scrum methodology. Every Monday, there was a team-wide Skype session, evaluating last week's sprint and setting goals for the week ahead. \"Working in weekly sprints with TIS ensures that you see clear progress and that we can adjust quickly if necessary.\" After the planned 5 weeks, the MVP was live at some Waive customers.", "You can clearly see that the expertise of the TIS team is an enormous added value for early stage start-ups. First, the transformation of Waive's initial plans into a concrete development plan saves a lot in time-to-market and budget. Secondly, TIS ensured the quality and robustness of developments by implementing minor quality improvements on its own initiative. \"Especially in the MVP phase, it is important for startups that the development partner can guarantee quality and prevent downtime with customers.\""],

Robert Vrancken, CTO at Gradyent: \"We had a strong concept, ambitious plans, and were on the point of quickly establishing a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) without hiring an entire team internally. TIS turned out to be the flexible all-round partner we were looking for to help us achieve this MVP.\"",
    "TISSuggested": ["“TIS suggested forming a cross-functional team including a Product Owner, a Solution Architect, and few developers. We first co-created a Proof of Concept (POC) with which we could attract the first investments to fund the development of the MVP. In short iterations, according to the Scrum methodology, the team continued to build and deliver the MVP in time. Together they realized the designs, the (cloud) architecture, the automated deployment process, the environment, the back- and frontend, and the integration with the AI/ML Core.\"", "\"We are very proud of the collaboration that we have managed to achieve in a short time and the team dynamics that have emerged within the team. TIS has really shown to have expertise in this area. Integration with our team was very organic as if you were really onboarding your own people,” says Vrancken."]
